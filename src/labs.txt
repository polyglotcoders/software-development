h1. Setup your bash profile

h2. Goals

* Create a bash profile / modify it if it exists
* We do this section so we can have a prettified version of iterm2

h2. What is a bash profile?

p. Where environment settings are stored. When a new iterm2 session starts, it will load the contents of the bash profile before executing commands.

h2. Open up @~/.bash_profile@

Execute:
sublime ~/.bash_profile

p. This should have opened up sublime text for you

h2. Copy paste this into the text editor and save

File: .bash_profile

h2. Reload the file

Execute:
source ~/.bash_profile

----------------------------------------------------------------------

h1. All about the command line

h2. Goals

* Understand the command line and what its purpose is

h2. A command line is a text interface for your computer.

* Open finder and open iTerm2 (aka our command line)
* Go to your home directory (normally your name) on Finder
* Now type @ls@ on iTerm2.
* You should see the exact same directories (also called "folders"). Your command line is just
a different way to access your computer and run commands! @ls@ is a 
command to list the files in the current directory you are in (which happens to be 
the home directory)

<img src="ls.png" style="width: 750px;"></img>

----------------------------------------------------------------------

h1. Learn some basic command line commands

h2. Goals

* Learn what cd, ls, sublime, pwd, mkdir, mv, rm commands do
* Learn what ~ means

h2. mkdir

p. @mkdir@ stands for "make directory"

Execute:
mkdir Development

h2. sublime

p. @sublime <filename>@ means open sublime text and make a file called <filename>

Execute:
sublime hello_world.py

p. Now SAVE the file.

Execute:
ls

p. You should now see the file within your home directory! Video is down below (my shortcut to open sublime text is subl instead of sublime)

<video width="1440" height="1080" autoplay controls controlsList="nofullscreen nodownload novolume" >
  <source type="video/mp4" src="helloworld.mp4"></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

h2. cd

p. @cd@ stands for "change directory"

h3. Change directories relative to your current directory
* @.@ means "current directory"
* @..@ means "the directory above the current one"

Execute:
cd . #means "stay in the current directory"
cd .. #means "change to the directory above us"
cd ~ #means "change to the home directory"
cd Development #means "change to a directory called Development"

* Note that you can use tab to autocomplete directory names / paths.
* Note that you can mix and match. To go two parent directories up, do @cd ../../<dirname>@ and etc.

<img src="sameterminal.png" style="width: 750px;"></img>

h3. Change directories based on an absolute path

h2. pwd

p. @pwd@ is used to get the absolute path of a current directory

p. So far, we've only gotten paths "relative" to the current directory. A "relative" path is like giving directions. Go back, go forward. An "absolute" path is like giving the address.

Execute:
pwd

<img src="pwd.png" style="width: 250px;"></img>

* Note: @cd ~@ is equivalent to @cd /Users/<home_directory_name>@

h2. mv

p. @mv@ is used to move files or directories to different paths

<h3><b>Execute:</b></h3>
<pre class="instructions">mv /Users/<home_directory_name>/hello_world.py /Users/<home_directory_name>/Development</pre>
<pre class="instructions">cd ~/Development</pre>
<pre class="instructions">ls</pre>

p. You should see the directory "hello_world.py" within Development now.

h2. rm

p. Todo yourself. Figure out what rm does, and use it on hello_world.py!


----------------------------------------------------------------------

h1. Signup for Slack and Slack Etiquette

h2. Goals

* Create a slack account
* Add your picture, and introduce yourself
* Ask your first coding question in Slack

h2. Create a slack account

* Accept your email invitation to slack

h2. Add a photo to your profile and introduce yourself to everybody!

* Don't be shy and make sure to send a fun emoji whenever a peer introduces themselves!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Setup Git Locally

h3. Definitions
* Local: your own computer


h2. Goals

* To setup git and ruby so that it is ready for work.

h2. Setup Name and Email

p. If you have never used git before, you need to do some setup first.
Run the following commands so that git knows your name and email

execute:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com"

h2. Setup Line Ending Preferences

Also, for Unix/Mac users:

execute:
git config --global core.autocrlf input
git config --global core.safecrlf true

h2. Setup Ruby 

p. For this tutorial you need a working Ruby interpreter. If you haven´t one 
installed yet, it is time to set it up now:

"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/":https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Signup for Github, Fork Repo, and Polyglot workflow

p. Now that we set up git locally, we want to sign up for a github account online.
Github allows you to "push" your code up online. To do that, your local project should be
a git repo. We'll learn more about this in class, but for now, we'll be forking a repo,
then cloning it locally.

h2. Goals

* Create a github account, request access to Polyglot's repo, and retrieve your own fork
* Understand what remote refers to
* Remember what commands you have to run when you make a change and want everybody to see
* Remember what commands you have to run when you want to get the latest lectures and handouts

h3. Definitions
* Repository/Repo: a folder containing your project's files and folders

h2. Go to github.com

* Make an account at "https://github.com/":https://github.com/
* Use the email you set up in the last lab

h2. Send your github username 

* Go to the #githubaccounts channel on slack ("channel":https://polyglotcoding.slack.com/messages/CDBQS6YMV/) and send your username to gain access to the repo. You will be notified via email when you receive your invite to the repo.

It should look like this

<img src="invite-polyglot.png" style="width: 750px;"></img>

h2. Fork the Repository

p. When we "fork" a repo, we make a copy of someone else's repo and add it to our own account

* Go to "https://github.com/polyglotcoders/cohort-1/":https://github.com/polyglotcoders/cohort-1/
* Press @Fork@
<img src="fork_img.png" style="width: 750px;"></img>


p. You should have been redirected to a a new url. The repo should now be on your account, rather
than Polyglot's

<img src="own_repo.png" style="width: 750px;"></img>

h2. Clone the Repository

p. Cloning a repository to us means we take a repository from the internet and make a copy in our local computer.


* Press @Clone or download@
* Press @Use HTTPS@
* Copy the code
<img src="clone.png" style="width: 750px;"></img>


h2. Add a remote "upstream"

h3. Definitions
* Remote: Think of it as a channel. There are multiple copies of each "repo" depending on the owner. For your own, we go to channel/remote "origin". For Polyglot's own repo, we'll call it "upstream"


</br>
**Now open up iterm2 (cmd + space then type iterm2)**

<h3><b>Execute:</b></h3>
<pre class="instructions">cd
mkdir Development
cd Development
mkdir polyglot
cd polyglot
git clone https://github.com/coderbea/cohort-1.git
cd cohort-1
git remote -v
git remote add upstream https://github.com/polyglotcoders/cohort-1.github
git remote -v</pre>
<p><b>Confirm you get something similar to below:</b></p>
<h3><b>Output:</b></h3>
<pre class="sample">
open-command$ git remote -v close-command
origin https://github.com/coderbea/cohort-1.git (fetch) br-line
origin  https://github.com/coderbea/cohort-1.git (push) br-line
open-command$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/polyglotcoders/cohort-1.github close-command br-line
open-command$ git remote -v close-command br-line
origin  https://github.com/coderbea/cohort-1.git (fetch) br-line
origin  https://github.com/coderbea/cohort-1.git (push) br-line
upstream  https://github.com/polyglotcoders/cohort-1.github (fetch) br-line
upstream  https://github.com/polyglotcoders/cohort-1.github (push) br-line
</pre>

h2. Make a change

p. Now that you have a clone of your fork of Poylglot's "cohort-1" repo, make a change!

Execute:
mkdir sandbox
cd sandbox
pwd
=pwd
ls
=ls
sublime hello.py

<h3><b>Output:</b></h3>
<pre class="sample">
open-command $ pwd close-command
/Users/bea/Development/polyglot/cohort-1
open-command $ ls close-command
handouts    lectures    images    sandbox
</pre>

File: hello_world.py
# A sublime text window should have opened up. Write anything
# you want in it! I will put this.

print("Hello World!")
EOF

p. Now save the file!

h2. Check the status of the repo and changes you made

h3. Definitions
* **Staging**: A list of changes to get committed. Imagine you're packing up stuff in a box.
Sometimes you take things out, sometimes you put it in. The box is the staging area.
* **Commit**: A list of changes with a name for the group of changes. You put the lid on the box
and labeled it "Ballet stuff"

Execute:
git status
=git_status

Output:
=git_status
EOF

h2. Add the "untracked files" to staging

Execute:
git add .
=git_add
git status
=git_status

Output:
=git_add
=git_status
EOF


h2. Commit the changes

**Commit the changes with a message! AKA "ballet stuff"** 

Execute:
git commit -m "[workflows] add a new helloworld file"
=git_commit

Output:
=git_commit
EOF


h2. Push the changes

h3. Definitions
* **Push**: Remember when you cloned the repo and added a remote "upstream"? Well now
we're going to "push" the files to that url on origin! So now your code will be online
and on github on your own repo.

h4. Let's look at our remotes

Execute:
git remote -v
=git_remote

Output:
=git_remote
EOF

**If you copy paste that URL, without the .git / .github on the end, it'll send you directly
to the either your own (origin) fork of polyglot's repo, or polyglot's (upstream) repo.**

**Make sure you push to origin always! You only pull from upstream, but you push all your
changes to origin**

<h3><b>Execute:</b></h3>
<pre class="instructions">git push origin master</pre>

<h3><b>Output:</b></h3>
<pre class="sample">
open-command $ git push origin master close-command
To https://github.com/coderbea/cohort-1.git

   02c27bb..be543f1  master → master
</pre>

h2. Take a look at your change online!

p. Remember, pushing to origin means we push it to the url listed on git remote -v for origin. Go to that URL, which is just your fork of the repo 

<video width="960" height="720" autoplay controls controlsList="nofullscreen nodownload novolume" >
  <source type="video/mp4" src="pushed.mp4"></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>




h2. Summary!

p. You'll be surprised to learn that our git "workflow" and most of the commands we'll use
will consist of the below.

Code:
git pull upstream master  #get the latest code from polyglot's master "branch"
<fill out handout / make a change>
git diff  # Optional. See all the changes you made
git status # Optional. See changes before adding it to "staging"
git add . # Add all changes to "staging" (like a draft, no saving)
git status # Optional. Confirm that the changes are staged
git commit -m "Finished handout 1"  # commit all changes (saying yes, I want to name and log this change to my computer)
git push origin master  # push changes online to github (I want to save it on the internet!)

If we take out all the optional code:

Code:
git pull upstream master # Get all changes from polyglot's offical repo
<fill out handout / make a change> # Make all changes at "local"
git add . # Add all changes to "staging"
git commit -m "Finished handout 1" # Add all changes to "commited"
git push origin master
